            <p>My life is an interesting journey so far! <br>
            I was born and raised in South Korea and was very fortunate to move to United States in 2008.<br>
            I have graduated middle school and high school in the state of Washington and was able to pursue a major in business and management in University of Washington. <br>
            As a Korean citizen, I have done 21 months of mandatory military service. After my service, I worked at a themepark called Everland that is owned by Samsung. <br>
            After 4 years, I came back to United States and had a sudden urge to change my major into Information studies which had both technical and communicative aspect. <br>
            I'm an outgoing person who loves to hang out and communicate with people. I love giving positive energy and sharing that feeling with my friends and family. <br>
            Studying at Michigan has motivated me more than ever that I have grown the passion to learn so I contribute in creating a user-friendly environment for people.
